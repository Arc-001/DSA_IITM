# PDSA IITM Notes

These are my notes from the course PDSA at IIT Madras.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following files:

- **PDSA_notes_colab.ipynb**: The original Jupyter Notebook containing my notes.
- **pdsa.py**: The same notes converted into a Python script.

## File Descriptions

### PDSA_notes_colab.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook contains detailed notes and code examples from the PDSA course. It includes explanations of concepts, problem-solving techniques, and Python code implementations.

### pdsa.py

This Python script is a direct conversion of the Jupyter Notebook. It includes all the code cells from the notebook, organized into a single script file.
